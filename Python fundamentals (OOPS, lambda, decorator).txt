1. Question: What are the four pillars of OOP in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: Encapsulation (bundling data and methods, hiding internals), Inheritance (reusing code from parent classes), Polymorphism (same interface, different behaviors), Abstraction (hiding complexity, showing essentials).
Sample code:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self): pass
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, r): self.r = r
    def area(self): return 3.14 * self.r ** 2
```
Layman term: OOP pillars are like building blocks: encapsulation wraps gifts (data safe inside), inheritance passes traits to kids, polymorphism acts differently in roles, abstraction shows only the TV remote buttons, not the wires.

2. Question: Explain encapsulation with an example.
Expected answer by interviewer: Encapsulation bundles data and methods, restricts access using _ (protected) or __ (private) conventions to hide internals.
Sample code:
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__balance = 0
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0: self.__balance += amount
    def get_balance(self): return self.__balance
acc = BankAccount(); acc.deposit(100); print(acc.get_balance())
```
Layman term: Like a capsule pill hiding medicine inside; you take the whole thing without seeing or messing with contents.

3. Question: What is inheritance in Python? Types?
Expected answer by interviewer: Child class inherits from parent for code reuse. Types: single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, hybrid.
Sample code:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self): print("Animal speaks")
class Dog(Animal):  # Single inheritance
    def speak(self): print("Dog barks")
d = Dog(); d.speak()
```
Layman term: Like kids inheriting eye color from parents; child gets parent's features and can add their own.

4. Question: Differentiate method overloading vs overriding.
Expected answer by interviewer: Overloading (same method name, different params; simulated in Python with defaults). Overriding (child redefines parent's method).
Sample code:
```python
class Calc:
    def add(self, a, b=0): return a + b  # Overloading simulation
class Sub(Calc):
    def add(self, a, b): return a - b  # Overriding
c = Sub(); print(c.add(5, 3))
```
Layman term: Overloading is like a Swiss knife with multiple blades for one tool; overriding is a kid saying "I'll do it my way" to parent's recipe.

5. Question: What is polymorphism in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: "Many forms"; runtime via overriding, compile-time via overloading simulation. Allows same method call on different objects.
Sample code:
```python
class Bird: def fly(self): return "Flying high"
class Penguin(Bird): def fly(self): return "Swimming instead"
b = Bird(); p = Penguin(); print(b.fly(), p.fly())
```
Layman term: One word "run" means sprint for athlete, dash for car; same action, different execution.

6. Question: Explain abstraction in Python.
Expected answer by interviewer: Hides details, shows essentials; use ABC module for abstract classes/methods.
Sample code:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Payment(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self): pass
class CreditCard(Payment):
    def process(self): return "Processed via card"
```
Layman term: Like a car dashboard; you see speed, not engine gears turning.

7. Question: What is a class vs an object in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: Class is blueprint/template; object is instance of class with actual data.
Sample code:
```python
class Car: pass  # Blueprint
my_car = Car()  # Object instance
```
Layman term: Class is house plan; object is the built house you live in.

8. Question: What is the __init__ method?
Expected answer by interviewer: Constructor; initializes object attributes when instance created.
Sample code:
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
p = Person("Alice", 30); print(p.name)
```
Layman term: Like setting up a new phone; __init__ installs apps and sets name on first power-on.

9. Question: What is 'self' in Python classes?
Expected answer by interviewer: Refers to current instance; first param in methods, accesses attributes.
Sample code:
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name): self.name = name
    def bark(self): print(f"{self.name} barks!")
d = Dog("Rex"); d.bark()
```
Layman term: 'Self' is like "me" in a mirror; points to the specific dog barking, not all dogs.

10. Question: Explain class variables vs instance variables.
Expected answer by interviewer: Class vars shared by all instances (defined outside methods); instance vars unique per object (self.var).
Sample code:
```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canine"  # Class var
    def __init__(self, name): self.name = name  # Instance var
d1 = Dog("Rex"); d2 = Dog("Spot"); print(d1.species, d1.name)
```
Layman term: Class var is family name (all dogs canine); instance var is personal name (Rex or Spot).

11. Question: What are class methods? Use @classmethod.
Expected answer by interviewer: Bound to class, not instance; take 'cls' as first arg; for factory methods or class ops.
Sample code:
```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canine"
    @classmethod
    def get_species(cls): return cls.species
print(Dog.get_species())
```
Layman term: Like a family rule book; accessed by family name, not individual member.

12. Question: What are static methods? Use @staticmethod.
Expected answer by interviewer: Utility methods; no 'self' or 'cls'; belong to class but don't access instance/class state.
Sample code:
```python
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b): return a + b
print(Math.add(2, 3))
```
Layman term: Like a calculator in a toolbox; works without knowing whose toolbox it is.

13. Question: Explain multiple inheritance in Python.
Expected answer by interviewer: Class inherits from multiple parents; use MRO (Method Resolution Order) for conflicts.
Sample code:
```python
class Flyer: def fly(self): return "Flying"
class Swimmer: def swim(self): return "Swimming"
class Duck(Flyer, Swimmer): pass
d = Duck(); print(d.fly(), d.swim())
```
Layman term: Kid gets traits from both mom and dad; if conflict, Python decides order like "mom first".

14. Question: What is the diamond problem in multiple inheritance?
Expected answer by interviewer: Ambiguity when two parents inherit from same grandparent; Python uses C3 linearization for MRO to resolve.
Sample code:
```python
class A: def method(self): return "A"
class B(A): pass
class C(A): pass
class D(B, C): pass  # MRO: D -> B -> C -> A
d = D(); print(d.method())
```
Layman term: Grandpa gives gift to two uncles; which uncle passes to kid? Python lines up uncles fairly.

15. Question: What are abstract classes in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: Can't instantiate; define abstract methods with ABC; force subclasses to implement.
Sample code:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self): pass
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self): return "Meow"
```
Layman term: Like a contract; you sign but must fill in details, or it's invalid.

16. Question: Explain method overriding with super().
Expected answer by interviewer: Child redefines parent method; super() calls parent version for extension.
Sample code:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self): return "Sound"
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self): return super().speak() + " - Woof"
d = Dog(); print(d.speak())
```
Layman term: Kid copies parent's homework but adds own doodles; super() includes parent's part.

17. Question: What are magic methods or dunder methods?
Expected answer by interviewer: Special methods like __init__, __str__; define operator behavior, string rep, etc.
Sample code:
```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y): self.x, self.y = x, y
    def __str__(self): return f"({self.x}, {self.y})"
    def __add__(self, other): return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
p1 = Point(1,2); p2 = Point(3,4); print(p1 + p2)
```
Layman term: Secret spells; __add__ makes + work like wizardry for custom objects.

18. Question: What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__?
Expected answer by interviewer: __str__ for user-friendly string (print()); __repr__ for developer rep (debug, unambiguous).
Sample code:
```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title): self.title = title
    def __str__(self): return f"Book: {self.title}"
    def __repr__(self): return f"Book('{self.title}')"
b = Book("Python"); print(b); print(repr(b))
```
Layman term: __str__ is casual chat; __repr__ is full ID card details.

19. Question: Explain property decorators for encapsulation.
Expected answer by interviewer: @property for getter, @attr.setter for setter; control access like private vars.
Sample code:
```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius): self._radius = radius
    @property
    def radius(self): return self._radius
    @radius.setter
    def radius(self, r): if r > 0: self._radius = r
c = Circle(5); print(c.radius); c.radius = 10
```
Layman term: Like a safe door; property is peephole to see, setter is key to change, but only if valid.

20. Question: What is a lambda function in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: Anonymous single-expression function; used for short callbacks, e.g., with map/filter.
Sample code:
```python
double = lambda x: x * 2
print(double(5))  # 10
nums = [1,2,3]; print(list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums)))
```
Layman term: Quick note scribble; "double this" without naming a full recipe.

21. Question: When would you use lambda over a def function?
Expected answer by interviewer: For simple, one-off functions in functionals like sorted(key=lambda), or inline.
Sample code:
```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
sorted_names = sorted(names, key=lambda name: len(name))
print(sorted_names)  # ['Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie']
```
Layman term: Lambda is sticky note for tiny tasks; def is full notebook for complex ones.

22. Question: Explain decorators in Python.
Expected answer by interviewer: Functions wrapping other functions; add behavior without changing code; use @decorator syntax.
Sample code:
```python
def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        import time; start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Time: {time.time() - start}")
        return result
    return wrapper
@timer
def slow_add(a, b): time.sleep(1); return a + b
print(slow_add(2, 3))
```
Layman term: Wrapper gift paper; adds bow (logging) around present (function) without opening it.

23. Question: How do you create a decorator with parameters?
Expected answer by interviewer: Decorator factory returns actual decorator; outer takes params, inner wraps function.
Sample code:
```python
def repeat(times):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(times): func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
@repeat(3)
def say_hi(): print("Hi!")
say_hi()
```
Layman term: Custom wrapper machine; "repeat 3 times" sets how many layers of paper.

24. Question: What are list comprehensions?
Expected answer by interviewer: Concise list creation from iterable; [expr for item in iterable if cond].
Sample code:
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(squares)  # [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```
Layman term: Shortcut recipe; bake squares from numbers, skip odds.

25. Question: Difference between list and dict comprehensions?
Expected answer by interviewer: List: [expr for ...]; Dict: {key: value for ...}; for key-value pairs.
Sample code:
```python
evens = {x: x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}
print(evens)  # {0: 0, 2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36, 8: 64}
```
Layman term: List is shopping list; dict is price tags for items.

26. Question: What are generators in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: Functions with yield; produce values lazily, memory efficient for large sequences.
Sample code:
```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0: yield n; n -= 1
for num in countdown(5): print(num)
```
Layman term: Vending machine; dispenses one snack (value) at a time, not the whole bag.

27. Question: Difference between iterators and iterables?
Expected answer by interviewer: Iterable has __iter__ (e.g., list); iterator has __next__ and exhausts.
Sample code:
```python
nums = [1,2,3]  # Iterable
it = iter(nums)  # Iterator
print(next(it))  # 1
```
Layman term: Iterable is book; iterator is page-turner that remembers spot.

28. Question: Explain *args and **kwargs.
Expected answer by interviewer: *args: variable positional args (tuple); **kwargs: variable keyword args (dict).
Sample code:
```python
def func(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args, kwargs)
func(1,2, name="Alice", age=30)  # (1, 2) {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
```
Layman term: *args packs loose items in box; **kwargs labels boxes with tags.

29. Question: What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?
Expected answer by interviewer: Mutex in CPython; one thread executes bytecode at a time; limits CPU parallelism but ok for I/O.
Sample code:
```python
import threading
def worker(): pass
threads = [threading.Thread(target=worker) for _ in range(10)]
for t in threads: t.start(); t.join()
```
Layman term: Single bathroom lock in house; only one uses at a time, even if many need it.

30. Question: Explain shallow vs deep copy.
Expected answer by interviewer: Shallow: copies top level, shares nested (copy.copy); Deep: recursive copy (copy.deepcopy).
Sample code:
```python
import copy
lst = [[1,2],[3,4]]
shallow = copy.copy(lst)
deep = copy.deepcopy(lst)
lst[0][0] = 99
print(shallow[0][0])  # 99
print(deep[0][0])     # 1
```
Layman term: Shallow photocopies cover, shares pages; deep copies every page fully.

31. Question: What are exceptions? How to handle?
Expected answer by interviewer: Errors during execution; use try-except-else-finally for handling.
Sample code:
```python
try: x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError: print("Can't divide by zero")
else: print("Success")
finally: print("Cleanup")
```
Layman term: Exceptions are tripwires; try walks carefully, except catches fall, finally tidies up.

32. Question: Difference between 'is' and '=='?
Expected answer by interviewer: == compares value; is compares identity (same object).
Sample code:
```python
a = [1,2]; b = [1,2]
print(a == b)  # True
print(a is b)  # False
```
Layman term: == asks "same content?"; is asks "same person?".

33. Question: What are namespaces in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: Mapping names to objects; types: built-in, global, local; avoids conflicts.
Sample code:
```python
x = "global"
def func():
    x = "local"
    print(x)
func(); print(x)
```
Layman term: Address book; different rooms (scopes) have own entries for "x".

34. Question: Explain zip() function.
Expected answer by interviewer: Pairs iterables into tuples; stops at shortest.
Sample code:
```python
keys = ['a','b']; vals = [1,2]
print(dict(zip(keys, vals)))  # {'a':1, 'b':2}
```
Layman term: Zipper merges two jackets side by side.

35. Question: What is slicing in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: Extract subsequence; seq[start:end:step].
Sample code:
```python
lst = [0,1,2,3,4]
print(lst[1:4])  # [1,2,3]
print(lst[::-1]) # [4,3,2,1,0]
```
Layman term: Cookie cutter on dough; cuts slice from start to end.

36. Question: Difference between mutable and immutable?
Expected answer by interviewer: Mutable changeable in place (list, dict); immutable new object on change (str, tuple).
Sample code:
```python
s = "hi"; s += "!"  # New string
lst = [1]; lst.append(2)  # Same list
```
Layman term: Mutable like clay (reshape); immutable like ice (melt and refreeze new).

37. Question: What is enumerate()?
Expected answer by interviewer: Adds index to iterable; for i, item in enumerate(iterable).
Sample code:
```python
fruits = ['apple','banana']
for i, f in enumerate(fruits): print(i, f)
```
Layman term: Numbered shopping list; tells position of each item.

38. Question: Explain map(), filter(), reduce().
Expected answer by interviewer: map applies func to all; filter keeps True; reduce accumulates (functools).
Sample code:
```python
from functools import reduce
nums = [1,2,3]
print(list(map(lambda x: x*2, nums)))  # [2,4,6]
print(list(filter(lambda x: x>1, nums)))  # [2,3]
print(reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, nums))  # 6
```
Layman term: Map paints all walls; filter picks blue ones; reduce folds paper into one.

39. Question: What are sets in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: Unordered unique collections; fast membership, no duplicates.
Sample code:
```python
s = {1,2,2}; print(s)  # {1,2}
print(1 in s)  # True
```
Layman term: Bag of unique marbles; no doubles, quick to check if one is inside.

40. Question: Explain pickling/unpickling.
Expected answer by interviewer: Serialize/deserialize objects to/from bytes; use pickle module.
Sample code:
```python
import pickle
data = {'key': 'value'}
with open('data.pkl', 'wb') as f: pickle.dump(data, f)
with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as f: loaded = pickle.load(f)
print(loaded)
```
Layman term: Pickling jars fruit for storage; unpickling opens jar to eat.

41. Question: What is PIP?
Expected answer by interviewer: Package Installer for Python; installs modules from PyPI.
Sample code:
```python
# Command line: pip install requests
import requests
```
Layman term: App store for Python; downloads tools you need.

42. Question: Explain function annotations.
Expected answer by interviewer: Metadata for params/return; type hints, no runtime effect; use mypy for checks.
Sample code:
```python
def greet(name: str, age: int) -> str:
    return f"Hello {name}"
```
Layman term: Sticky notes on function; "this expects string" for future you.

43. Question: What are exception groups (Python 3.11+)?
Expected answer by interviewer: Group multiple exceptions; use except* for handling; for concurrent tasks.
Sample code:
```python
from exceptiongroup import ExceptionGroup
try:
    raise ExceptionGroup("Errors", [ValueError("Bad"), TypeError("Wrong")])
except* ValueError:
    print("Value errors caught")
```
Layman term: Basket of error fruits; pick specific types without dumping all.

44. Question: Explain context managers (with statement).
Expected answer by interviewer: Manage resources; __enter__/__exit__; auto cleanup.
Sample code:
```python
class FileManager:
    def __enter__(self): self.file = open('test.txt', 'w'); return self
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb): self.file.close()
with FileManager(): pass
```
Layman term: Doorman; opens door on enter, locks on exit, even if you trip.

45. Question: What is a generator expression?
Expected answer by interviewer: Compact generator; (expr for item in iterable); lazy like gen func.
Sample code:
```python
squares = (x**2 for x in range(5))
print(list(squares))  # [0,1,4,9,16]
```
Layman term: Lazy recipe list; cooks one square at a time when asked.

46. Question: Difference between range() and xrange()?
Expected answer by interviewer: In Py3, range is xrange-like (lazy range object); Py2 range list, xrange generator.
Sample code:
```python
r = range(3); print(type(r))  # <class 'range'>
for i in r: print(i)
```
Layman term: Range is ticket numbers; doesn't print all at once, just on demand.

47. Question: What is the collections module? Examples.
Expected answer by interviewer: Specialized containers; defaultdict, Counter, deque, namedtuple.
Sample code:
```python
from collections import Counter
c = Counter("hello"); print(c)  # Counter({'l': 2, 'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'o': 1})
```
Layman term: Fancy toolbox; Counter tallies votes, deque is quick-add line.

48. Question: Explain defaultdict.
Expected answer by interviewer: Dict subclass; missing keys return default factory value (e.g., list).
Sample code:
```python
from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)
d['key'].append(1); print(d['key'])  # [1]
```
Layman term: Smart fridge; empty shelf auto-fills with default (list) when you reach.

49. Question: What is deque?
Expected answer by interviewer: Double-ended queue; efficient append/pop from both ends.
Sample code:
```python
from collections import deque
d = deque([1,2,3]); d.appendleft(0); d.pop(); print(d)  # deque([0,1,2])
```
Layman term: Train car; add/remove from front or back quickly.

50. Question: Explain namedtuple.
Expected answer by interviewer: Tuple subclass with named fields; lightweight class-like.
Sample code:
```python
from collections import namedtuple
Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(1,2); print(p.x)  # 1
```
Layman term: Labeled ticket; access seat by name, not just number.

51. Question: What is the difference between delete, remove, pop in lists?
Expected answer by interviewer: del by index; remove by value (first); pop by index (returns value).
Sample code:
```python
lst = [1,2,3,2]
del lst[1]; print(lst)  # [1,3,2]
lst.remove(2); print(lst)  # [1,3]
print(lst.pop(1))  # 3
```
Layman term: Del erases position; remove hunts value; pop grabs and removes.

52. Question: Explain for vs while loops.
Expected answer by interviewer: For iterates known sequence; while condition-based, until false.
Sample code:
```python
for i in range(3): print(i)  # 0 1 2
i=0; while i<3: print(i); i+=1  # 0 1 2
```
Layman term: For is bus route (fixed stops); while is wait till rain stops.

53. Question: What are break, continue, pass?
Expected answer by interviewer: Break exits loop; continue skips iteration; pass placeholder.
Sample code:
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3: break
    if i == 1: continue
    print(i)  # 0 2
pass  # No-op
```
Layman term: Break flees room; continue ignores and peeks next; pass stands still.

54. Question: How to reverse a list?
Expected answer by interviewer: lst[::-1] slice; lst.reverse() in place; reversed(lst).
Sample code:
```python
lst = [1,2,3]; print(lst[::-1])  # [3,2,1]
```
Layman term: Mirror view; shows backward without flipping original.

55. Question: What is split() and join()?
Expected answer by interviewer: Split string to list by delimiter; join list to string with sep.
Sample code:
```python
s = "a b c"; print(s.split())  # ['a','b','c']
print(' '.join(['a','b','c']))  # a b c
```
Layman term: Split chops log; join glues sticks.

56. Question: Explain string methods: lower(), upper(), etc.
Expected answer by interviewer: lower() all lowercase; upper() uppercase; strip() remove whitespace.
Sample code:
```python
s = "Hello"; print(s.lower())  # hello
```
Layman term: lower whispers quietly; upper shouts loud.

57. Question: What is len()?
Expected answer by interviewer: Returns length of sequence/container.
Sample code:
```python
print(len("abc"))  # 3
print(len([1,2]))  # 2
```
Layman term: Ruler for words or lists; counts items.

58. Question: How to add to lists: append vs extend?
Expected answer by interviewer: Append adds single item; extend adds all from iterable.
Sample code:
```python
lst = [1]; lst.append([2]); print(lst)  # [1,[2]]
lst = [1]; lst.extend([2]); print(lst)  # [1,2]
```
Layman term: Append drops package; extend unpacks and adds contents.

59. Question: What is array module?
Expected answer by interviewer: Efficient typed arrays; faster than lists for numbers.
Sample code:
```python
import array
a = array.array('i', [1,2,3]); a.append(4); print(a)
```
Layman term: Typed lunchbox; only sandwiches (ints), no mix.

60. Question: Difference between arrays and lists?
Expected answer by interviewer: Arrays homogeneous type, memory efficient; lists heterogeneous.
Sample code:
```python
import array; a = array.array('i', [1,2]); lst = [1,'a']
```
Layman term: Array uniform uniforms; list mix-and-match clothes.

61. Question: How to randomize a list?
Expected answer by interviewer: random.shuffle() in place.
Sample code:
```python
import random
lst = [1,2,3]; random.shuffle(lst); print(lst)
```
Layman term: Shake box of toys; random order spills out.

62. Question: What is scope resolution?
Expected answer by interviewer: LEGB rule: Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in; global keyword for global access.
Sample code:
```python
x = 10
def func():
    global x; x = 20
func(); print(x)  # 20
```
Layman term: Search order: pocket, room, house, toolbox.

63. Question: What is memory management in Python?

Sample code:
```python
import gc; gc.collect()  # Manual GC
```
Layman term: Librarian tracks borrowers; cleans forgotten books in circles.

64. Question: Explain function closures.
Expected answer by interviewer: Function with enclosing scope access; remembers outer vars.
Sample code:
```python
def outer(x):
    def inner(y): return x + y
    return inner
add5 = outer(5); print(add5(3))  # 8
```
Layman term: Inner letter in envelope; carries outer message forever.

65. Question: What are higher-order functions?
Expected answer by interviewer: Functions taking/returning functions; e.g., map.
Sample code:
```python
def apply_twice(func, x): return func(func(x))
print(apply_twice(lambda x: x*2, 3))  # 12
```
Layman term: Chef using recipes on recipes; double cook.

66. Question: Explain recursion with example.
Expected answer by interviewer: Function calls itself; base case stops; e.g., factorial.
Sample code:
```python
def fact(n): return 1 if n <= 1 else n * fact(n-1)
print(fact(5))  # 120
```
Layman term: Russian dolls; each opens smaller, stops at tiniest.

67. Question: What is the walrus operator (:=) in Python 3.8+?
Expected answer by interviewer: Assignment expression; assigns and returns value inline.
