### Part 1: Theory of Math in Python

#### What is Math in Python?
Math in Python refers to the use of built-in functions, standard library modules, and third-party libraries to perform mathematical operations, ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced computations like linear algebra, statistics, and numerical analysis. Python’s `math` module provides core mathematical functions, while libraries like `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `SymPy` extend capabilities for scientific computing. In 2025, math in Python is critical for data science, machine learning, financial modeling, and web applications, with frameworks like FastAPI and Django leveraging these tools for analytical tasks.

#### Key Components
1. **Built-in Math Operations**:
   - Python supports basic arithmetic: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), floor division (`//`), modulo (`%`), and exponentiation (`**`).
   - Example: `5 + 3` yields `8`, `2 ** 3` yields `8`.

2. **math Module**:
   - The `math` module provides functions for trigonometry, logarithms, factorials, and constants like `pi` and `e`.
   - Example: `import math; math.sqrt(16)` returns `4.0`.

3. **NumPy**:
   - A third-party library for numerical computations with arrays, supporting operations like matrix multiplication, statistical analysis, and linear algebra.
   - Example: `import numpy as np; np.array([1, 2]).sum()` returns `3`.

4. **SciPy**:
   - Extends NumPy with advanced scientific functions for optimization, integration, and signal processing.
   - Example: `from scipy import integrate; integrate.quad(lambda x: x**2, 0, 1)` integrates \(x^2\) from 0 to 1.

5. **SymPy**:
   - A library for symbolic mathematics, supporting algebra, calculus, and equation solving.
   - Example: `from sympy import symbols, solve; x = symbols('x'); solve(x**2 - 1, x)` returns `[-1, 1]`.

6. **Statistics Module**:
   - The `statistics` module provides functions for mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.
   - Example: `import statistics; statistics.mean([1, 2, 3])` returns `2`.

7. **Random Module**:
   - The `random` module supports random number generation, useful for simulations and sampling.
   - Example: `import random; random.randint(1, 10)` returns a random integer between 1 and 10.

#### How Math Works in Python
- **Execution**:
  - Built-in operations are executed directly by Python’s interpreter.
  - Library functions (`math`, `NumPy`, etc.) are optimized for performance, often using C-based implementations.
- **Precision**:
  - Python’s `float` uses double-precision (64-bit) for most operations.
  - `decimal` module for high-precision arithmetic.
  - Example: `from decimal import Decimal; Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.2')` avoids floating-point errors.
- **Vectorization**:
  - NumPy uses vectorized operations for efficiency, avoiding loops.
  - Example: `np.array([1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4])` yields `[4, 6]`.
- **Symbolic vs. Numeric**:
  - Numeric (`math`, `NumPy`): Compute approximate values (e.g., `sin(π/2) ≈ 1.0`).
  - Symbolic (`SymPy`): Work with exact expressions (e.g., `sin(π/2) = 1`).
- **Randomness**:
  - `random` uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm for pseudo-random numbers.
  - `numpy.random` for advanced random number generation.

#### Key Features
- **Flexibility**:
  - Python supports both simple arithmetic and complex scientific computations.
- **Extensibility**:
  - Libraries like `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `SymPy` extend Python’s math capabilities.
- **Performance**:
  - NumPy/SciPy leverage C for fast computations; `math` is optimized for standard tasks.
- **Interoperability**:
  - Integrate with `pandas` for data analysis, `matplotlib` for visualization, and TensorFlow for machine learning.
- **Precision Control**:
  - Use `decimal` or `mpmath` for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

#### Use Cases

  - **Pydantic**: Validate numerical inputs.
  - **SQLAlchemy**: Perform calculations in database queries.
  - **Streamlit/Dash**: Visualize mathematical results.

#### Advanced Concepts
- **Linear Algebra**:
  - NumPy provides `dot`, `inv`, `eig` for matrix operations.
  - Example: `np.dot(np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]), np.array([1, 1]))` computes matrix-vector product.
- **Calculus**:
  - SymPy for symbolic differentiation/integration; SciPy for numerical integration.
  - Example: `from sympy import diff, symbols; x = symbols('x'); diff(x**2, x)` returns `2*x`.
- **Statistics**:
  - `statistics` for basic stats; `scipy.stats` for distributions and hypothesis testing.
  - Example: `from scipy.stats import norm; norm.cdf(0)` returns `0.5`.
- **Random Number Generation**:
  - `numpy.random` for seeded random numbers in simulations.
  - Example: `np.random.seed(42); np.random.rand(3)` generates reproducible random numbers.
- **Performance**:
  - **Time Complexity**:
    - Basic arithmetic: O(1).
    - Matrix multiplication: O(n^3) for n×n matrices.
    - Symbolic operations: O(n^k) depending on expression complexity.
  - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for arrays/matrices of size n.
- **Async Integration**:
  - Use math in async applications (e.g., FastAPI) for real-time analytics.
  - Example:
    ```python
    import asyncio
    import math
    async def calc():
        return math.sqrt(16)
    ```
- **Type Hints**:
  - Use `float`, `int`, or `np.ndarray` for type-safe math operations.
  - Example: `from typing import List; def sum_list(nums: List[float]) -> float`.

#### Best Practices
- Use `math` for simple calculations; `NumPy` for large-scale numerical tasks.
- Leverage `SymPy` for symbolic math and `SciPy` for scientific computations.
- Use `decimal` for financial calculations requiring high precision.
- Set seeds for reproducible random numbers in testing.
- Test math logic with `pytest` to handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero).
- In 2025, integrate with `pandas` for data analysis and `FastAPI` for API-based analytics.
- Document mathematical assumptions (e.g., units, precision) in code.
- Optimize performance by using vectorized operations in NumPy.
