1. Question: How do you handle JSON data in Python using the built-in module?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use the json module to serialize (convert Python objects to JSON) and deserialize (convert JSON to Python objects). json.dumps() for strings, json.dump() for files, json.loads() for strings, json.load() for files.
Sample code:
```python
import json

# Serialize Python dict to JSON string
data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
json_string = json.dumps(data, indent=4)
print(json_string)

# Deserialize JSON string to Python dict
parsed_data = json.loads(json_string)
print(parsed_data)

# Write to file
with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=4)

# Read from file
with open('data.json', 'r') as f:
    loaded_data = json.load(f)
print(loaded_data)
```
Layman term: JSON is like a lightweight way to store and share data, similar to a dictionary in Python. The json module helps convert between Python's data structures and this text format, making it easy to save or send data over the web.

2. Question: What is the difference between json.dumps() and json.dump()?
Expected answer by interviewer: json.dumps() converts a Python object to a JSON string, while json.dump() writes the JSON directly to a file object.
Sample code:
```python
import json
data = {'key': 'value'}
# dumps to string
json_str = json.dumps(data)
# dump to file
with open('file.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f)
```
Layman term: Think of dumps as creating a string version of your data for immediate use, like printing, while dump saves it straight to a file, like exporting a document.

3. Question: How would you handle large JSON files efficiently in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use streaming parsing with libraries like ijson to process the file in chunks without loading everything into memory, or use json.load() with file streaming for moderate sizes.
Sample code:
```python
import ijson

with open('large.json', 'r') as f:
    items = ijson.items(f, 'item')
    for item in items:
        print(item)  # Process each item one by one
```
Layman term: Large JSON files are like huge books; instead of reading the whole thing at once, you read page by page to avoid overwhelming your memory.

4. Question: How do you implement robust error handling when working with JSON data?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use try-except blocks to catch JSONDecodeError for parsing issues, validate with jsonschema, and log errors.
Sample code:
```python
import json
from jsonschema import validate

try:
    data = json.loads('{"key": "value"}')
    schema = {"type": "object", "properties": {"key": {"type": "string"}}}
    validate(instance=data, schema=schema)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f"Invalid JSON: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Validation error: {e}")
```
Layman term: Error handling is like having safety nets; if the JSON is malformed (like a typo in a recipe), you catch it early to prevent crashes.

5. Question: What strategies would you use to optimize JSON parsing performance?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use faster libraries like ujson, stream large files, avoid unnecessary deserialization, and benchmark with time module.
Sample code:
```python
import ujson
import time

start = time.time()
data = ujson.loads('{"large": "data"}')  # Faster than json.loads
end = time.time()
print(f"Time taken: {end - start}")
```
Layman term: Optimization is speeding up a slow car; use a turbo library like ujson instead of the standard one for quicker data processing.

6. Question: How do you prettify JSON output for readability?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use the indent parameter in json.dumps() or json.dump() to add spaces and new lines.
Sample code:
```python
import json
data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
pretty_json = json.dumps(data, indent=2)
print(pretty_json)
```
Layman term: Prettifying is like formatting a messy note into bullet points, making it easier for humans to read without changing the meaning.

7. Question: How do you validate JSON data in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use json.tool in terminal for syntax, or libraries like jsonschema for schema validation.
Sample code:
```python
# Terminal: python -m json.tool data.json
# In code:
import jsonschema
instance = {"name": "Bob"}
schema = {"type": "object", "required": ["name"]}
jsonschema.validate(instance, schema)
```
Layman term: Validation checks if your data follows the rules, like verifying a form is filled correctly before submission.

8. Question: What are common libraries for advanced JSON parsing in Python?
Expected answer by interviewer: Built-in json for basics, ujson for speed, ijson for streaming large files, jsonschema for validation.
Sample code:
```python
import ujson
data = ujson.dumps({'fast': True})
```
Layman term: These are tools in your toolbox; json is the hammer for everyday, ujson is the power drill for heavy jobs.

9. Question: How do you ensure security when parsing JSON?
Expected answer by interviewer: Avoid eval(), use trusted sources, validate input, update libraries to patch vulnerabilities.
Sample code:
```python
import json
try:
    data = json.loads(user_input)  # Safe, unlike eval
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    print("Invalid input")
```
Layman term: Security is locking your door; don't use unsafe methods like eval() that could let in bad data like a virus.

10. Question: Explain the process of parsing JSON from a file end-to-end.
Expected answer by interviewer: Open file, use json.load() to parse into dict/list, process data, handle errors.
Sample code:
```python
import json
try:
    with open('file.json', 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    # Process data
    print(data['key'])
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    print("Invalid JSON")
```
Layman term: Parsing is translating foreign text; open the book, convert to your language, then read and use the info.

11. Question: How do you read a CSV file using Python's csv module?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use csv.reader() for lists or csv.DictReader() for dictionaries, handling headers and dialects.
Sample code:
```python
import csv
with open('data.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row['column_name'])
```
Layman term: CSV is like a simple table in a text file; the csv module reads it row by row, like scanning a spreadsheet.

12. Question: How do you write data to a CSV file?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use csv.writer() or csv.DictWriter(), specify fieldnames for headers.
Sample code:
```python
import csv
data = [{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}]
with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=['name', 'age'])
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(data)
```
Layman term: Writing is exporting your list to a table format, like saving contacts to a file for import elsewhere.

13. Question: How do you handle large CSV files without loading into memory?
Expected answer by interviewer: Read in chunks using csv.reader() in a loop, process line by line.
Sample code:
```python
import csv
with open('large.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    next(reader)  # Skip header
    for row in reader:
        # Process row
        print(row[0])
```
Layman term: Like eating a big meal bite by bite instead of all at once to avoid indigestion.

14. Question: What is csv.DictReader and when to use it?
Expected answer by interviewer: It reads CSV into ordered dictionaries using the first row as keys, useful for named access.
Sample code:
```python
import csv
with open('data.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row['name'])
```
Layman term: Instead of numbered columns like "column 1", it gives names like "name" for easier reference, like labeled folders.

15. Question: How do you handle different CSV dialects?
Expected answer by interviewer: Specify dialect parameter or use Sniffer to detect, handling quotes, delimiters.
Sample code:
```python
import csv
with open('data.csv', 'r') as f:
    dialect = csv.Sniffer().sniff(f.read(1024))
    f.seek(0)
    reader = csv.reader(f, dialect)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```
Layman term: Dialects are regional accents in data; sniffer figures out if it's comma or semicolon separated.

16. Question: How to compute min difference from CSV data (e.g., goal differential)?
Expected answer by interviewer: Parse with DictReader, calculate abs difference, find min using loop or min().
Sample code:
```python
import csv
def get_min_diff(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        min_diff = float('inf')
        min_team = None
        for row in reader:
            diff = abs(int(row['Goals For']) - int(row['Goals Against']))
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
                min_team = row['Team']
        return min_team, min_diff
```
Layman term: Like finding the closest scores in a sports table by subtracting and picking the smallest gap.

17. Question: How to handle errors in CSV parsing, like malformed rows?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use try-except in loop, skip invalid rows, or validate before processing.
Sample code:
```python
import csv
with open('data.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        try:
            value = int(row[1])  # Potential error
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid row, skipping")
            continue
```
Layman term: If a row is messed up, like a letter where a number should be, skip it to keep going.

18. Question: How do you append to an existing CSV file?
Expected answer by interviewer: Open in 'a' mode, use writer, but match headers if needed.
Sample code:
```python
import csv
new_row = ['John', 30]
with open('data.csv', 'a', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(new_row)
```
Layman term: Appending is adding a new line to the end of a list, like updating a log without rewriting everything.

19. Question: Explain csv.writerows() vs writerow().
Expected answer by interviewer: writerow() for single row, writerows() for list of rows.
Sample code:
```python
import csv
rows = [['a',1], ['b',2]]
with open('data.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(rows)
```
Layman term: One adds a single item, the other dumps a whole batch at once for efficiency.

20. Question: How to read CSV from string instead of file?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use io.StringIO to treat string as file-like object.
Sample code:
```python
import csv
import io
csv_string = 'name,age\nJohn,30'
with io.StringIO(csv_string) as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```
Layman term: Like reading from memory instead of disk, useful for data from web or variables.

21. Question: How do you read data from a specific cell in an Excel spreadsheet using OpenPyXL?
Expected answer by interviewer: Load workbook, select sheet, access cell by coordinate and get .value.
Sample code:
```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook
wb = load_workbook('sample.xlsx')
sheet = wb.active
value = sheet['A1'].value
print(value)
```
Layman term: Excel cells are like grid squares; specify row and column to peek inside one.

22. Question: How do you iterate through rows in a column range with OpenPyXL?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use iter_rows() with min/max col/row, values_only=True for data.
Sample code:
```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook
wb = load_workbook('sample.xlsx')
sheet = wb.active
for row in sheet.iter_rows(min_row=1, max_row=5, min_col=1, max_col=3, values_only=True):
    print(row)
```
Layman term: Iterating is walking through the table row by row, grabbing values without extras.

23. Question: How do you append new data to an existing Excel file with OpenPyXL?
Expected answer by interviewer: Load workbook, write to cell or use append(), save with new name if needed.
Sample code:
```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook
wb = load_workbook('hello.xlsx')
sheet = wb.active
sheet.append(['new', 'data'])
wb.save('hello_updated.xlsx')
```
Layman term: Appending adds to the bottom, like extending a list in a notebook.

24. Question: How do you create a new Excel spreadsheet and add data?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use Workbook(), active sheet, assign to cells, save.
Sample code:
```python
from openpyxl import Workbook
wb = Workbook()
sheet = wb.active
sheet['A1'] = 'Hello'
wb.save('new.xlsx')
```
Layman term: Starting fresh is creating a blank page and writing on it.

25. Question: How do you add a formula like AVERAGE to an Excel cell?
Expected answer by interviewer: Assign string starting with '=' to cell.
Sample code:
```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook
wb = load_workbook('sample.xlsx')
sheet = wb.active
sheet['A10'] = '=AVERAGE(A1:A9)'
wb.save('sample.xlsx')
```
Layman term: Formulas are auto-calculations; tell Excel to sum or average a range.

26. Question: How do you apply conditional formatting in OpenPyXL?
Expected answer by interviewer: Create DifferentialStyle, Rule, add to sheet's conditional_formatting.
Sample code:
```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook
from openpyxl.styles import PatternFill
from openpyxl.styles.differential import DifferentialStyle
from openpyxl.formatting.rule import Rule
wb = load_workbook('sample.xlsx')
sheet = wb.active
red_fill = PatternFill(start_color='EE1111', end_color='EE1111', fill_type='solid')
dxf = DifferentialStyle(fill=red_fill)
rule = Rule(type='cellIs', operator='lessThan', formula=['10'], dxf=dxf)
sheet.conditional_formatting.add('B2:B100', rule)
wb.save('sample.xlsx')
```
Layman term: Conditional formatting colors cells based on rules, like highlighting low scores in red.

27. Question: How do you adjust row height and column width in OpenPyXL?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use row_dimensions and column_dimensions.
Sample code:
```python
from openpyxl import Workbook
wb = Workbook()
sheet = wb.active
sheet.row_dimensions[1].height = 50
sheet.column_dimensions['A'].width = 20
wb.save('adjusted.xlsx')
```
Layman term: Adjusting sizes makes the table look better, like resizing columns in a document.

28. Question: How do you merge cells in an Excel sheet using OpenPyXL?
Expected answer by interviewer: Use sheet.merge_cells() with range string.
Sample code:
```python
from openpyxl import Workbook
wb = Workbook()
sheet = wb.active
sheet.merge_cells('A1:B2')
wb.save('merged.xlsx')
```
Layman term: Merging combines cells into one big one, like spanning a header over columns.

29. Question: How do you add arithmetic operations like SUM in OpenPyXL?
Expected answer by interviewer: Assign formula to cell, e.g., '=SUM(A1:A5)'.
Sample code:
```python
from openpyxl import Workbook
wb = Workbook()
sheet = wb.active
sheet['A1'] = 1
sheet['A2'] = 2
sheet['A3'] = '=SUM(A1:A2)'
wb.save('sum.xlsx')
```
Layman term: It's embedding math directly in the sheet for automatic updates.

30. Question: How do you handle reading multiple sheets in an Excel file?
Expected answer by interviewer: Load workbook, access by name or index, iterate if needed.
Sample code:
```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook
wb = load_workbook('multi.xlsx')
for sheet_name in wb.sheetnames:
    sheet = wb[sheet_name]
    print(sheet['A1'].value)
```
Layman term: Sheets are like tabs in a browser; switch between them to access different data sets.
